The provided code defines a custom Set class using Java's TreeSet to manage a collection of Game objects, which are sorted based on their price due to the Comparable interface implemented in the Game class. The Set class offers basic set operations such as adding, removing, checking containment, checking if empty, getting the size, and clearing all elements, while ensuring all elements are non-null. The TreeSet is a type of binary search tree (specifically a Red-Black tree), which maintains elements in sorted order and allows efficient operations like search, insert, and delete in O(log n) time. The ScannerDriver class provides a command-line interface to interact with this set, enabling users to perform various operations through a menu-driven approach.

 what is set?

 A Set is a  data structure that stores a collection of unique elements, meaning no duplicates are allowed. It is commonly used to test for membership, i.e., whether a specific element is present in the set, efficiently. Sets are typically implemented using hash tables or binary search trees. Hash table implementations provide average time complexity of O(1) for insertion, deletion, and membership testing, while tree-based implementations offer O(log n) complexities for these operations. Sets are useful in various applications, such as removing duplicates from a list, performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference, and implementing algorithms that require efficient lookups and membership tests.
